# xframe-reactive

The reactive system of `xFrame`, provides easy-to-use APIs to build fine-grained
reactive applications.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Example

```rs
use xframe_reactive::*;

create_root(|cx| {
    let state = cx.create_signal(1);

    let double = cx.create_memo(move || *state.get() * 2);
    assert_eq!(*double.get(), 2);

    state.set(2);
    assert_eq!(*double.get(), 4);

    state.set(3);
    assert_eq!(*double.get(), 6);
});
```
